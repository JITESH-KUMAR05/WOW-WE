      Founded in the U.S. through grassroots action in 1951, The Nature
      Conservancy (TNC) has grown to become one of the most effective and
      wide-reaching environmental organizations in the world. Thanks to more
      than a million members and the dedicated efforts of our diverse staff and
      over 400 scientists, we impact conservation in 79 countries and
      territories: 37 by direct conservation impact and 42 through partners.

          Nature conservation is crucial for preserving biodiversity,
          maintaining ecological balance, and ensuring sustainable resources for
          future generations. It protects ecosystems, supports climate
          regulation, and safeguards the well-being of both wildlife and humans.
          Conservation efforts contribute to a healthier planet and mitigate the
          impact of human activities on the environment.
